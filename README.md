# Python-projects

1) In the first project we will be creating a traffic signal which works on the library time.
   Using "cycle" from the 'intertools' library to make it more easier for the machine to understand and is more efficient.

2) In the second project we will be creating a rock,paper,scissors game which accepts user inputs.
   The computer choices are random using the "random" library.
